## Python Note

### List Comprehension:

### Decorator:
1. Decorators are functions that will return a new function
2. Decs without args: func = dec(func)
3. Decs with args: func = dec(args)(func)

### Functional & lambda:


### Variable Scope:
1. Global, nonlocal and local(nonlocal was added in python 3)

### Closure:

### Generator:

### Inheritance:
1. Python supports multiple inheritance
2. New style class has an ancestor - object. Classic class doesn't. Recommend using new style class
3. Instance methods take in self, but can be renamed to something else
4. __init__ will be called during instantiation
